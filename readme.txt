Everything is working fine.
 
Changes made by assistant:
- Added `home_page.html` (site home, includes slide-in single-line ad from the right and footer with name + ©2025).
- Added `about.html` (SMU email placeholder, Halifax phone with 902 area code, Google Map embed).
- Added `addreview.html` (form for submitting to zyBook form-viewer; placeholder action included — replace with provided zyBook URL).
- Added `images/star.svg` and `images/half-star.svg` (star graphics used for ratings).
- Updated `css/styles.css` with styles for slide-in ad and guest reviews.
- Kept `index.html` intact; `home_page.html` is the required home page file for submission.

Notes / To do by student:
- Replace `your-smu-username@smu.edu` in `about.html` with your actual SMU email if desired.
- If you have a specific zyBook form-viewer URL, update the `action` attribute in `addreview.html`.
- Verify and (optionally) replace star/restaurant images with licensed images if required by the assignment.
- Test `home_page.html` in a browser. The ad will slide in from the right when the page loads.

If anything else should be adjusted (message text, name, email, or map address), tell me and I'll update it.
